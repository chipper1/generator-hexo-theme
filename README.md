# hexo theme generator for yeoman
---
It's used to quickly scaffold a theme for hexo. The theme it creates is fully functional and has no design. That part is up to you!

### Features
---
It creates all of the necessary files you need to make your own theme.

You will be prompted for:
* the theme name
* hexo plugins directory (yes/no)
* Bower packages (yes/no)
* EditorConfig file (yes/no)
* JSHint file (yes/no)

### Install
---
```sh
npm install -g generator-hexo-theme
```

### Use
---
Navigate to the directory you want to place the theme project in.
```sh
mkdir mytheme
cd mytheme
yo hexo-theme
```
Then goto your hexo site project's `_config.yml` and switch the `theme` propery to what you have named it.
